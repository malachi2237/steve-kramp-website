                    Some essential dialogues about cultural renewal don’t happen
                    on their own. Rather, they require deep preparation,
                    courage, and chemistry. The following topics spark grateful
                    interaction simply because 1) they matter, 2) anyone paying
                    attention to our culture knows they matter, and 3) no one
                    else is tracing these lines of thought today.
